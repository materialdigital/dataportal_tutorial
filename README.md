### US2:
As a visiting user, I found some interisting datasets and i want to digest/consume them, for further analysis.

In the given scenario all functionalities are explained based on the dataset [42CrMoS4 Tensile Tests Fraunhofer IWM] (https://kit-pmd-4.ydns.eu/dataset/42crmos4-tensile-test-iwm). This dataset offers a wide range of different resources.

Once you have narrowed down your search explained in Story 1, you have several options to consume the data. 
![US2_1](./images/DataPotal_US2_1.png)

After clicking on the dataset, the “Dataset Overview Page” will appear with information about the dataset such as: 
- main contact person for the dataset
- publishing organization
- creator of the dataset
- and others

In this example, we are looking at a dataset that has been published by another person. Therefore, only the tabs Dataset and Groups are displayed. An additional "FUSEKI" tab will appear when viewing a record you have uploaded. How you can upload your own datasets will be explained in the chapter 3. 

![US2_2](./images/DataPotal_US2_2.png)

The icons associated with the resources indicate the different formats in which your the selected dataset is available. In this example we have CSV, Jason, TTL, TXT and more.

![US2_3](./images/DataPotal_US2_3.png)

In order to get a better overview of the data the button "Explore" offers further options depending on the resource format. You can "Preview" the file in your browser, "Download" it directly, or "Create a Mapping".

![US2_4](./images/DataPotal_US2_4.png)
![US2_5](./images/DataPotal_US2_5.png)

We suggest to click on the option **Preview**. Which takes you to the **Detail Page of the Dataset** and its different Resources.

The functionalities **Download** and **Create Mapping** are further explained underneath the description of the detailed page for the dataset.

#### Detail Page of Dataset: 
There are different buttons at the top of the explore page, depending on the format you selected in the previous step. The buttons shown in this example are available for CSV files. 
You will always find the URL, a short description of the record and the source code at the top of the page.
![US2_6](./images/DataPotal_US2_6.png)

#### Functionalities of Buttons at the top of the explore page

**Annotate:** The process of assigning information to linguistic data (especially corpus data, with linguistic information) is called annotation. Only when this process has been completed meaningful evaluations can be made. The emphasis in this case is on the enrichment with linguistic information.

#### Functionalities of Buttons on Top

**Annotate:**: : The process of assigning information to linguistic data (especially corpus data, with linguistic information) is called annotation. Only when this process has been completed can meaningful evaluations be made. The emphasis in this case is on the enrichment with linguistic information.

**Transform:** Run Transformation, if allowed and not done before, by clicking here a Turlk file is created. This file lists all annotations to the dataset. You can use if for further semantic operations.

**Download:** Provides a cleaned download of data. For some resource formats there is a dropdown menu embedded in the download button. Here you have the option to choose between different download format options.

![US2_10](./images/DataPortal_US2_10.png)

**Data API:** An API or Application Programming Interface is a messenger or a middleman that lets computer programs securely access data from one another.

#### Display Area "Preview"

Underneath the Dataset Description a preview of the data is displayed. Below shown is the preview for the CSV file but this can also vary depending on the selected format. 

#### Display Area "Resource"

Further down on the page indicated by **“Resource”** another functionality can be found. Here you can see which resource is selected and also switch between the different data formats/resources. 

#### Display Area "Data Dictionary"

The **Data Dictionary** is also an optional function which is displayed at the moment because the format CSV is selected.

![US2_7](./images/DataPotal_US2_7.png)

The picture below highlights two more areas of interest on the detail page. Area 1 (Resources) was already previously seen on the picture before. This area shows you which resource is currently selected. Here you have the option to switch between the different resources associated with the selected dataset. The dataset highlighted in grey is the one currently selected and all shown information on this detail page is referred to.

#### Display Area "Additional Information"

Shown area 2 – **Additional Information**- also can be found on each Detail Page of the dataset. Here is the information shown for the resource selected on the left.

Right Clicking on Explore and selecting Download either directly starts the download or takes you to the respective data source.

![US2_9](.images/DataPotal_US2_9.png)

#### Create Mapping
 
 By clicking on the option **Create mapping** for a given resource of the dataset you will be guided to the following page. 
 Create a rule bases mapping by filling the form below. It will query the given metadata file and the graph template by the Class IRI set for subjects and objects. When clicking "Start Mapping" select widgets will spawn allowing you to map a subject to an object. The resulting YAML file will contain a ruleset for each of the assertions made, and when run create triples connecting the subject meeting the condition by the predicate IRI given. Download the file, make changes if needed and upload it to the "mappings" group here in CKAN if you want to make use of the automated mapping process applying the mapping.
 
 ![US2_11](./images/DataPotal_US2_11.png)
 
 #### Good to Know
 
 **Groups:** The Group functionality is relevant for looged in users. The button Groups takes you to so far established groups. You can use CKAN Groups to create and manage collections of datasets. This could be to catalogue datasets for a particular project or team, or on a particular theme, or as a very simple way to help people find and search your own published datasets. Groups are meant to be used by the community of users of a site.
 
 ![Groups](./images/DataPotal_Groups.png)
 
 **Follow:**  The the Follow function is only relevant for by logged in users.

#### Final Remarks:
